## Project Structure
1. **Data Collection**
   - **Bowling**:
     - Number of pins knocked down per round.
     - Estimated throw angle.
     - Bowling speed categorized as "slow," "medium," or "fast."
     - Total score per player.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and organizing data to address missing or inconsistent values.
   - Separating features (inputs) and labels (outputs) for machine learning.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
   - Identifying trends (e.g., throw angle vs. pins knocked down) and anomalies.

4. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Developing a predictive model using Scikit-learn.
   - Evaluating model performance with metrics like accuracy or RÂ² score.

5. **LangChain Chatbot**
   - Designing a chatbot that suggests strategies based on collected data.
   - Utilizing pre-trained large language models via LangChain.
   - Deploying the chatbot (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio).

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above installed on your machine.
- Required libraries installed: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `langchain`.

### Steps
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use the provided data collection template to record game data.
   - Save the structured data in an Excel or CSV file.

2. **Preprocessing and EDA**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file provided in the repository.
   - Run the preprocessing steps to clean and organize the data.
   - Generate EDA visualizations and insights.

3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Use the cleaned dataset to train a machine learning model.
   - Run the script/notebook to evaluate model performance.

4. **LangChain Chatbot**:
   - Run the LangChain script to deploy the chatbot.
   - Input game data or strategies to test chatbot suggestions.
